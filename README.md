WaterBuddy Ultra+ is a colourful, animated hydration tracking web app designed to help users build healthy drinking habits in a fun, interactive way. Built with Python and Streamlit, it combines real-time tracking, friendly mascot reactions, and motivational visuals to make staying hydrated simple and enjoyable for everyone — from kids to adults.

The app lets users select their age group, automatically suggesting a recommended daily water goal that can also be adjusted. With one-click buttons like “+250 ml” or “+500 ml”, users can log their water intake instantly. A dynamic progress wave bar and a cheerful turtle mascot named Aqua react in real-time to each update — cheering, sipping, or resting depending on progress levels.

The sidebar provides daily hydration tips, a mood selector for Aqua, and even a mini hydration quiz that makes learning fun.
All data is displayed neatly in the Stats page, where users can view their intake history and compare it to their goals.

WaterBuddy Ultra+ combines coding logic, design creativity, and health awareness into one friendly and visually engaging web experience. It encourages small, consistent actions — turning hydration into a habit with smiles, emojis, and colours. 🌈💧🐢
